# React + TypeScript + Vite

- [x] Install VS Code Extension "Error Lens" to show in line errors in the code
- [x] Added styles from TodoMVC
- [x] Listing TODOs
- [x] Removing TODOs
- [x] Included "types" best practices by including the usage of Pick and Omit utility. Meaning if the id changes from "string" to "number" we do not have to modify the datatypes in each of the functions in which we hardcoded the type. Instead we can pick a type and update the type datatype as needed, in one place.
- [x] Marking TODOs as completed
- [x] Add a filter TODOs (Footer)
- [x] Show the number of pending TODOs
- [ ] Investigate what is Sustain to avoid drop drilling
